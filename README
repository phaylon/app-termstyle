USAGE
      term-style [<options>] <command> [<argument> ...]

OPTIONS
  --force
    Apply force to e.g. override an existing profile via "store" or

    and profiles should be stored. Defaults to "~/.app-termstyle-rc".

COMMANDS
  list
    Shows a list of stored profiles.

  store <name>
    Stores the current window properties in a profile named "<name>". This
    will abort when a profile with that name already exists. If you want to
    override the existing profile, use the "--force" option.

  rename <oldname> <newname>
    Renames the profile "<oldname>" to "<newname>". This will abort if a
    profile named "<newname>" already exists. If you want to override the
    existing profile, use the "--force" option.

  delete <name>
    Removes the profile "<name>" from storage.

  load <name>
    This will load the profile named "<name>" as the current terminal style
    profile. This will resize and reposition the current active terminal.
